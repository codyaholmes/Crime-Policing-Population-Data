# Crime-Policing-Population-Data
A collection of data to be used for comparing crime statistics and policing incidents by population groups against U.S. population distribution groups.

## Crime Data
The FBI_UCR_2015-2018 csv file comprises of multiple tables from the FBI's Uniform Crime Reporting website. I reorganized the source data in a format that is more conducive to visualization tools. I also excluded all ethnicity counts. Ethnicity counts were unreliable given that not all police departments report them. Listed below are source tables by year and linked location:

* [2015 Crime in the United States: Table 43A](https://ucr.fbi.gov/crime-in-the-u.s/2015/crime-in-the-u.s.-2015/tables/table-43)
* [2016 Crime in the United States: Table 21A](https://ucr.fbi.gov/crime-in-the-u.s/2016/crime-in-the-u.s.-2016/topic-pages/tables/table-21)
* [2017 Crime in the United States: Table 43A](https://ucr.fbi.gov/crime-in-the-u.s/2017/crime-in-the-u.s.-2017/topic-pages/tables/table-43)
* [2018 Crime in the United States: Table 43A](https://ucr.fbi.gov/crime-in-the-u.s/2018/crime-in-the-u.s.-2018/topic-pages/tables/table-43)

Years prior to 2015 were not included in the current dataset, but I am planning to add those soon. Years after 2018 are not included due to data not being available yet.
